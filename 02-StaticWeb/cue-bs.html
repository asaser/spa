	<h1 class="page-header">History</h1>
	<p>The university opened its doors on October 1, 1925 as College of<br> Commerce (<i>Wyższe Studium Handlowe</i>).
	<br>
	In 1939 the Nazis arrested several academy professors who later were<br> executed or sent to concentration camps. Two buildings of the school<br> were seized, and numerous library books and documents were lost.<br> Classes continued surreptitiously throughout the war, until the school<br>  was able to reopen in 1945. The school was nationalized in 1950 and<br> renamed as Higher School of Economics (<i>Wyższa Szkoła<br> Ekonomiczna</i>).
	<br><br>
	In 1974 it was renamed again, as Kraków Academy of Economics<br> (<i>Akademia Ekonomiczna w Krakowie</i>). In 2007 it received its current<br> name: Kraków University of Economics (<i>Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w<br> Krakowie</i>).
